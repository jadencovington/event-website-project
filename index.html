        <p>After launching “The Extra”, Jens Nygård Knudsen does more work on his design of a new LEGO figure. He wants to create a figure with more life. Part of his solution is to design a figure with movable arms and legs. Management hears about the new figure and orders it into production. It launches in 1978 under the name: LEGO minifigure. The minifigure becomes a huge hit. In fact, so much so that at the end of 2018, the year of its 40th anniversary, the number of total minifigures produced reaches 7.8 billion. The success is easy to understand; The minifigure brings life and roleplay to the LEGO brick and being four LEGO bricks tall, without hair or headpiece, it fits perfectly with the LEGO System in Play.</p>
